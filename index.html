            <h2>About </h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Aaron Wang, and I'm a high school senior at Strake Jesuit College Preparatory based in Houston, Texas. On this website, I share with you my passions, works, and projects. <br>
                <br> Growing up, I had an intense interest in mathematics and the sciences thanks to its predictability and objectivity. Being homeschooled for one year during the COVID-19 Pandemic, I developed a love for biology, which influenced many of my future engineering projects and literature/narrative reviews. <br>
                <br> However, when I started paying attention to the world around me, I found STEM in how logical systems worked together to shape our world. Yet I also saw how identity and power subjectively alter the course of modern events. Since then, I've been trying to plumb out the depths of the world by bridging <em>mathematical</em> and <em>empathetical</em> thinking in all that I do.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>(Current) 8 to 88: Formosan Fortune</h3>
            <p>I am currently editing a documentary that was filmed in the summer of 2025 that aims to reframe Taiwan not as a geopolitical pawn, but a dynamic intersection of identity, culture, and economics while generating new scholarship on indigenous communities. The completion date is slated for 2026, and Taiwan Plus, a Taiwanese Government funded entity, has expressed interest in licensing.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>(Current) Local Prosthetic Distribution Networks</h3>
            <p>I am currently working on scaling the production of low-cost mechanical prosthetic hands. Having produced and donated 30, I am in talks with local high schools with plans to implement production there. Additionally, I am in talks with local nonprofit clinics to begin distribution. <br><br><em>Note: These mechanical prosthetics do not require FDA Approval due to its designation as a class 1 medical devices. Class 1 medical devices are exempt from most regulation.</em><br><br> Pictures of these hands are available 
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zs1VEvPvosK0EdS-tN3sc0Vrdnd4Ro_w?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> for those curious.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>(Current) DWU NASA High School Engineering Challenge</h3>
            <p>Currently working with my school's engineering club as Paylod Systems Lead that specializes in detection, signaling, and sample collection for a multi-week NASA project to create a UAS (uncrewed aircraft system) for the agricultural industry.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>(Future) Myoelectric & Brain-Controlled Prosthetics</h3>
            <p>Inspired by Benjamin Choi's (Harvard '26) project that won the Grand Award for Regeneron ISEF by building a mind-controlled prosthetic hand, I hope to recreate that feat as an educational experience that integrates brain signaling and electronics. I have currently assebled a team but have not started yet.</p>
